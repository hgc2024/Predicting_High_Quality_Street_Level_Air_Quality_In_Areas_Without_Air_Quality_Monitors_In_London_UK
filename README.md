# Predicting_High_Quality_Street_Level_Air_Quality_In_Areas_Without_Air_Quality_Monitors_In_London_UK

This repository highlights my contributions towards a group project in the 2024 CUSP London Data Dive, which won the award for Best Technical Contribution. The research question chosen was how to predict air pollution levels in areas of London, UK without any air pollution monitors. The solution was to gather data from locations where air quality monitors are active, and merge relevant predictor factors such as traffic congestion levels and weather data. My particular contributions towards the project was performing data engineering to merge relevant datasets, and to train and test an LSTM model which can infer air pollution levels in areas with no monitors. 

The response variable of interest were the measurements of four different pollutants: N02, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2. The predictor variable were as following variables: time elapsed since beginning of the period of observation, total number of vehicles per hour, percentage of road capacity being used, type of air quality monitor installation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and the hour, day, month and year of the observation. The LSTM has an MSE of 72.082, which is less than the generic linear regression model with a MSE of 87.636. Apart from the data and source code, there is also a pdf of the group presentation.
